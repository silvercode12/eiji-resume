        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Greetings! I am Eiji Sunagawa. My fields of experience includes
          programming, physics research, materials science research, general
          research, data analysis, science communication, writing, and
          illustration. My programming skills include Python for programming and
          data analysis, website development &#40;HTML, CSS, Javascript&#41;,
          data analysis and engineering with SQL, and MATLAB. My interests lie
          also with programming, particularly with languages that I am
          unfamiliar with.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have experience developing a Python image processing software as
          part of my internship and have had multiple software development and
          data analysis projects using MATLAB and Python. Aside from
          programming-related experiences, in the physics and chemistry
          laboratories, I have knowledge and experience with general laboratory
          equipment and safety measures, specific experimentation devices such
          as sputtering and vacuum equipment, and characterization tools like
          SEM, UV/Vis spectroscopy, and those for mechanical testing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond academics and technical skills, I was also a student journalist
          and wrote articles related to science and technology. I am also a
          freelance/hobbyist digital illustrator since the pandemic. Overall,
          can bring both my analytical and creative side to bring about the best
          solutions.
